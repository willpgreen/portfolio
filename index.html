                    This was an interesting project meant to gain more experience writing JavaScript functions and conditional statetments. It is a simple calculator that allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. My largest issue was allowing the user to string together multiple operations and accounting for order of operations. I will let you know how I solved this issue when I solve it.
